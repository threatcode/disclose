# Convert JSON to CSV

This tool is designed to take program-list.json, and export an alphabetically sorted json file, and a csv that matches the content of that file.  
Once this sorting and conversion has been done, the output files are ready for a pull request. 

## How to use  
The script is a python3 script, which takes its arguments from the command line:

~~~~
-j, --jsonfile <JSONFILE> 
    Input json file

-oc, --outfile-csv <OUTFILE_CSV> 
    Output csv file

-oj, --outfile-json <OUTFILE_JSON> 
    Output json file
~~~~
